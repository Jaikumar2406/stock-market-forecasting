# 📉 Stock Market Forecasting using LSTM

This project predicts future stock prices using Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM), a type of Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) well-suited for time series forecasting. The model is trained on historical stock data and makes predictions for upcoming days.

---

## 🚀 Features

- Preprocessing of stock price data
- Normalization using MinMaxScaler
- LSTM model implementation using TensorFlow/Keras
- Visualization of training, testing, and future predictions
- Inverse transformation to get real stock prices
- Easy-to-understand results and plotted graphs

---

## 📊 Results

- The model predicts future stock prices with a visible **downward trend**, which may indicate a possible decline in stock value.
- Future predictions are displayed in the original price scale for better interpretation.
